Where a headless CMS shines the most is in projects that demand complex integrations, multi-channel content delivery and speed and scalability. If you're only planning to run a simple blog - you can still stick with Wordpress. But if you're planning to build a business where your content plays a major role - look into headless CMS as it will pay off big time."
